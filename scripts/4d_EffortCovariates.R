### SPECIES RICHNESS / 'EFFORT' ###
###################################

### Create effort proxy by regressing SR on other ecological covariates to untangle 
# ecological from survey effort-driven signal in richness. Include SR residuals for 
# both periods: Atlas 1 has disproportionate/asymmetric pull on what state transition 
# will be assigned per block per species; to discern source of effort bias, need 
# "baseline" effort to understand 'under-' and 'over-surveying' illuminated by 
# inclusion of resids for Atlas 2:
### Blocks poorly sampled in Atlas 1 will have low residuals, which will down-weight 
# apparent â€œextinction"; blocks with high residuals in Atlas 2 will up-weight 
# "colonization" since high effort means lowers probability of true non-detection.

# Put raw SR into the modeling df
